Hey guys, I'm learning about Github for the first time!
I've been applying for Computer Programming jobs, and I have noticed a number of them require git experience.

I am a Computer Science student at Athabasca Univeristy.
I know C++, Java, Python, HTML, and Lisp programming languages.
I have had experience with AI.

Currently, my brother and I are building a Self-Driving Car using a Raspberry Pi and Computer Vision.
