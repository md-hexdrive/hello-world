Hey guys, I'm learning about Github for the first time!
I've been applying for Computer Programming jobs, and I have noticed a number of them require git experience.

I am a Computer Science student at Athabasca Univeristy.
I know C++, Java, Python, HTML, and Lisp programming languages.
I have had AI experience.
Currently, I am enrolled in Athabasca's Embedded/Robotic Programming course, COMP 444.
